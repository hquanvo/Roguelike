# Roguelike video game

## Todo
- Fix monster behaviors to follow the current game time scheduling system
- Add inventory system, treasures, equipment, loot
- Add a boss floor/boss fight


### Note:
This project is likely getting shelved because I don't feel good about blatantly ripping off code from a tutorial and call it a personal project.
The repo will be made public but it's very unlikely that I will come back to this. It was a nice experience to understand how C# work at least.
